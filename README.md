# Automated-Linux-Server-Hardening-Toolkit-
Goals

    Automate common hardening tasks so they are reproducible and auditable.
    Be idempotent and safe to run on a test system (WSL/VM/cloud).
    Produce logs and a verification checklist so you can demonstrate results in your portfolio.

Features / Deliverables

    Bash scripts for quick local runs (idempotent).
    Ansible role/playbook for production-style automation.
    Verification script that checks and reports compliance for each rule.

Minimal Requirements

    A Linux machine (WSL Ubuntu is fine), or a small cloud VM.
    Bash, Ansible (for the Ansible part), Python 3 for verification/reporting.
